Making creating a deepfake as easy as answering a couple of questions

What the code in this repo does is use the trained neural network from the paper [First Order Motion Model for Image Animation](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/31c0b36aef265d9221af80872ceb62f9-Abstract.html), 
and the source code put together by Dimitris Poulopoulos in [their tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-produce-a-deepfake-video-in-5-minutes-513984fd24b6), but automates the processes they used to create deepfake videos. 

So by using this program anyone with a little bit of storage and an internet connection can create a relatively convincing deepfake. 

### Directions:
1. run "pip install deep-animator" in terminal or cmd
2. navigate to where you downloaded the code
3. run speculum.py
4. answer their questions
5. wait a little bit (great things take time)
6. Voila! A deepfake!
